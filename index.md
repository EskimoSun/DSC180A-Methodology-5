# What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

The most interesting part of our domain is the ability to leverage the immense power of current LLMs to account for many different factors and informations in order to make a decision. In quarter 1, we focused on implementing many of the state-of-the-art techniques to augment and enhance an LLM's reasoning capabilities based on existing information in order to reach a singular truthfulness result (but interpretable with many components).

# Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

I would like to pursue a goal similar to the ones that we set out to complete in Quarter 1, but at a much more advanced level, and incorporates many more techniques that could enhance the interpretability and reproduceability of the analysis of truthfulness. This may include creating a factual knowledge-graph that could be stored and used accordingly with the LLM API. 

# What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

I wish to incorporate more intuitive presentations and techniques to illustrate the factuality factor scores, and all the intermediate steps that help explain the details of how the veractiy of a news article was being determined. 

# What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I would like to use better dissecting techniques on the input texts, and compare to other sources of news, and be able to explain how the input texts reflects less or more misinformation, in certain ways (according to factuality factors).
